Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:
if a number is multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of this number,
if a number is multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of this number,
for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz",
print the rest of the numbers unchanged.
Output each value on a separate line.

def fizz_buzz(a):

  if a % 3 == 0 and a % 15 != 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif a % 5 == 0 and a % 15 != 0:
    print("Buzz")
  elif a % 15 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  else:
    print(str(a))
